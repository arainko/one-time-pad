a wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul like
 these sweet mornings of spring which i enjoy with my whole hear
t i am alone and feel the charm of existence in this spot which 
was created for the bliss of souls like mine i am so happy my de
ar friend so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil ex
istence that i neglect my talents i should be incapable of drawi
ng a single stroke at the present moment and yet i feel that i n
ever was a greater artist than now when while the lovely valley 
teems with vapour around me and the meridian sun strikes the upp
er surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees and but a few
 stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary i throw myself down
 among the tall grass by the trickling stream and as i lie close
 to the earth a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me when i
 hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks and grow fam
iliar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and 
flies then i feel the presence of the almighty who formed us in 
his own image and the breath of that universal love which bears 
and sustains us as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss a
nd then my friend when darkness overspreads my eyes and heaven a
nd earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power like the 
form of a beloved mistress then i often think with longing oh wo
uld i could describe these conceptions could impress upon paper 
all that is living so full and warm within me that it might be t
he mirror of my soul as my soul is the mirror of the infinite go

the weight of the splendour of these visionsa wonderful serenity
